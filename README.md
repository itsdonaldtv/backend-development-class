# Your homework (if you choose to accept)
## Creating a HTML 
First create your HTML web page and use styling to make it your own original and creative web page. The functionality that you add and plan to add to your webpage should support the requirements of your JS functions

## Adding some JavaScript
To show your progress I would like to see your own creative webpage, and I want to see you utilise at least 3 events. 1 of these events must be onClick and 1 must be onSubmit or form submit

## Requirements

Create a html page with CSS styling

Add a JavaScript function to handle onclick
Add a JavaScript function to handle submission of data
Add a JavaScript function to handle your own choice of event (no repeats!)

Add a JavaScript function to create an object using the data you've passed in
Add a JavaScript function as one of the fields inside your object on creation

Display the data or have a way to show how these requirements are met (ties in with the HTML page)

### Bonus brownie points
Make use of booleans to help logic flow in your web page!
